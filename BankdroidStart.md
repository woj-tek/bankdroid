# Introduction #

Bankdroid START is a simple online banking client that is built on the **Csaba** connectors (see http://csaba.googlecode.com).


# Details #

Though the original Bankdroid concept is that the bank information is downloaded and maintained on local database of the Android device, the Start is only concentrating on the connectivity testing of the Csaba connectors.

Anyway, it will result in a usable application, that can give you some comfortable functionality, such as remembering last login Ids, or quick access to your accounts from native application instead of web site.

# Version 1.0 #

The following functions will be covered:
  * **login with bank selection**, bank specific login screen, and remembering of last login if you ask for
  * **account list with overview** and detail screens
  * transaction history with quick links from accounts, and detailed search options.
  * **logout**
